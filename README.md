# Memory Game Project

## What is
It is a simple card game, used to test the memory of the players.

## How to play
The player must find all pairs of cards, revealing the cards two at a time. If you find a pair, keep the cards open, otherwise turn the cards
down and try again.

## Challenge
Find all pairs with the least amount of movement.

## Score
* 1 star by finding all pairs;
* 2 stars for finding all pairs in up to 18 moves.
* 3 stars for finding all pairs in up to 12 moves.

## How I build the game
* I used basic HTML and CSS to structure the board with the cards;
* I created a deck of 8 pairs of cards (16 cards) that is scrambled whenever the page is loaded or updated;
* I added a motion counter to make the game more challenging;
* I added a timer to know the duration of the game;
* I added some animations when revealing the cards, to make the look more interesting;
* I created a pop-up window when winning, congratulating the player.
